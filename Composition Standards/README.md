# Composition Standards

Documents the compositional analysis of dried algal biomass based on standard analytical procedures to determine the proximate biochemical composition (ash, protein, lipid and total carbohydrate content) of the material. All data is reported as the mean ± standard deviation of triplicate analyses.

# Material Sourcing

Macroalgae biomass was air dried and packaged at Oceanium, UK, and shipped to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), in Golden, Colorado.

The biomass was homogenized to <2 mm particle size in the presence of dry ice and analyzed for full proximate composition using established procedures, including methods for total carbohydrates (including uronic acids after acid hydrolysis), lipids, as fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), protein and solids were determined based on previously published procedures: https://www.nrel.gov/bioenergy/microalgae-analysis.html

Determination of Carbohydrates, Two-step sulfuric acid hydrolysis to hydrolyze the polymeric forms of carbohydrates in algal biomass into monomeric subunits. The monomers are then quantified by either high- performance liquid chromatography, in particular high-performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) [6] Uronic acids were analyzed in the same assay, but analyzed separated by HPAEC-PAD, as a control, alginic acid was included in the reaction and the recovery of the sum of the monomeric detected guluronic and mannuronic acid was 95.58% of the alginic acid dry weight [6]; Determination of Lipids as FAME, Following whole biomass, in situ transesterification of lipids to fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), followed by gas chromatography [8]; Determination of Solids, A convection oven drying procedure is used for total solids content, at 40°C under vacuum, and a dry oxidation method at 575°C for ash content; Determination of Protein, Protein content is determined via elemental nitrogen content and conversion via a 4.92 nitrogen-to-protein factor [4]; Summative Mass Analysis, Integration of LAPs to measure algal biomass constituents in an unambiguous manner and ultimately achieve mass balance closure [7]

# Margin of Error

To minimize error in the analysis of the SRM, ISO guide 35 and IRMM guidelines were followed. Multiple analysts characterized this material and between batches, samples have been investigated for homogeneity.
