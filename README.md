## Development of Integrated Screening, Cultivar Optimization, and Verification Research (DISCOVR)

The DISCOVR team constitutes a powerful partnership among four of the Department of Energy’s seventeen national laboratories: Los Alamos National Laboratory, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories.

We are a team of biofuels and biotechnology experts who are joining forces to investigate algae strains that could lead to sustainable and clean algal biofuel. Capabilities in our home laboratories—such as PNNL’s Laboratory Environmental Algae Pond Simulator photobioreactors, NREL’s biomass characterization and valorization tools, LANL’s strain identification and improvement approaches, and Sandia’s indoor crash testing ponds —are key to our success. Learn more about the team here (https://discovr.labworks.org/). Additionally, there is a collaborative partnership with the Arizona Center for Algae Technology and Innovation (AzCATI), which has an outdoor algae testbed facility at Arizona State University (https://azcati.asu.edu/).

The objective of DISCOVR is to develop an integrated screening platform for the discovery of high-productivity and resilient strains of algae that can be cultivated outdoors year-round via crop rotation to facilitate the execution of DOE-EERE Bioenergy Technologies Office's (BETO) annual Algae State of Technology (SOT) experimental support effort, which involves demonstrating progress towards out-year biomass productivity goals as outlined in the BETO Multi-Year Program Plan. Data collection

This repo contains NREL projects under the designation of DISCOVR, with each project existing in a separate folder. Below is a list of project:

Composition Standards: standardized formatting for distribution of composition data
SOT : analyzing productivity and composition at the interface of light, temperature, and environmental conditions for algae cultivation
